  - **n_plus_one**: Multiple database queries, Database load
  - **slow_query**: Long database query times, Database bottlenecks
  - **js_errors**: JavaScript errors, Browser monitoring alerts
  - **bad_vitals**: Poor Core Web Vitals, User experience degradation

#### 2. Load Test with New Relic Monitoring Simulation
- ✅ Load test configuration validation (5 users, 2 minutes)
- ✅ Request distribution calculation based on endpoint weights

#### 3. Performance Issue Detection
- ✅ Performance threshold definitions (6 thresholds)
- ✅ Alert triggering simulation (4 alerts triggered):
  - 🚨 CRITICAL: Response time = 2.5s (threshold: 2.0s) on /performance/slow
  - 🚨 CRITICAL: Response time = 3.2s (threshold: 2.0s) on /performance/slow-query
  - 🚨 CRITICAL: Database time = 2.8s (threshold: 1.0s) on /performance/slow-query
  - 🚨 WARNING: CPU usage = 75.0% (threshold: 70.0%) on system

#### 4. Monitoring Data Continuity
- ✅ Continuous monitoring simulation (5 minutes, 30-second intervals)
- ✅ Data gap detection (no gaps found)
- ✅ Performance trend analysis (5 significant trends detected)
- ✅ Timeline data generation and validation

#### 5. New Relic Dashboard Metrics

  - 📊 APM Overview (Response time, Throughput, Error rate, Apdex score)
  - 📊 Web Transactions (Top slowest transactions, Transaction traces)
  - 📊 Database Performance (Response time, Query throughput, Slow queries)
  - 📊 Browser Monitoring (Page load time, Core Web Vitals, JS errors)
  - 📊 Infrastructure (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network I/O)
  - 📊 Error Analytics (Error rate, Top error classes, Error distribution)

#### 6. Alert Configuration
- ✅ Alert policy definitions (3 policies, 7 conditions):
  - 🚨 Load Test Performance Alerts
  - 🚨 Infrastructure Monitoring
  - 🚨 Database Performance
- ✅ Alert notification simulation (2 notifications)

### Test Results
